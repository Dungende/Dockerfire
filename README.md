## 📃 Paper server
Already configured Minecraft server based on [@PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC) core to use on low-end hardware for Linux-based OS

### 🤔 What files are configured?
1. server.properties — Minecraft server config
2. bukkit.yml — CraftBukkit config
3. spigot.yml — Spigot core config (since Spigot is a fork of CraftBukkit)
4. paper.yml — Paper core config (since Paper is a fork of Spigot)
4. start.sh — bash script to start the server (mostly took from [@Dymeth](https://github.com/Dymeth))

### 🏃 How to run the server?
Linux: type `./start.sh` in Terminal
Windows: `start.bat` - double-click / type in cmd/PowerShell

### 💡 Features of the startup bash script
1. Restarts the server on its crash or stop (to stop completely — press Ctrl+C on restart countdown)
2. Includes [@aikar](https://github.com/aikar)'s JVM optimization flags
3. Runs the server in a new screen (server won't stop if you corrupt the SSH session)
4. Easy-to-configure JVM basic flags (e.g. maximum RAM usage)
5. Preconfigured JVM flags (e.g. **nogui**)
